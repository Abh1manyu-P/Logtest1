            console.log("See, that's the thing. No one that knows what the weapon is has survived. All except the Supreme Leader. He is the only living thing in the galaxy that knows what it is.");
            console.log("And that is because he himself control's it while he and the weapon are completely invisible. That of course is a miracle in itself");
